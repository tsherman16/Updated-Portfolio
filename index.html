      <p> I was born in Portland, Oregon, but have lived in Arizona for practically my whole life. I graduated from the
        University of Arizona with a degree in Marketing. I met my wife in college and am now married for about two
        years. During my free time I like to watch sports or stay active. The activities I do to stay active are the
        gym, soccer, basketball, swimming, hiking, and walking my dog. My dog's name is Jax and he is
        a 3 year old Golden Retriever. Unlike my wife and I he is not active and prefers to lay around and get a lot of
        belly rubs and play tug of war.</p>

      <p>I love watching movies, especially at the theater. My favorite types of movies are comedy, action, thriller,
        and drama. I hate horror movies and will refuse to go to them, this also includes going to haunted houses. I
        don't play as many video games as I used to, but when I do I play sports games like Madden, NBA2K, and FIFA. I'm
        a basic millenial and love brunch, especially at OHSO. My favorite foods are chicken and waffles or pretty much
        any mexican food.
